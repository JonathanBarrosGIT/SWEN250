================================================================
Start
Estimated Time 2 00
Plan:
After understanding what the assignment required, the goal was to handle the iterations through the arrays and
print the answer as the required format.
 
Complete
Actual Time    1 30
Observations:
I could learn new array techniques such as Array.first and Array.last in order to use the map (It was perfect because
in this case the sub-array only contains 2 data (first and last). And I also learn the 'kind_of?' method in order to
assure the Data type of certain object, that was good to receive either String or Array as argument.
