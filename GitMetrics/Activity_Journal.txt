SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	2 00
Plan:
All the 3 methods are pretty similar, once developed the first, the following ones would be easy. The idea was
simply go through the array and look for sub-strings inside each line according to what the pattern presented in the
provided files, and then count the occurrences.

Complete
Actual Time	3 40
Observations: I could practice a bit more the Date type. Also, how to handle sub-strings inside Strings. There wasn't
any big issue in doing this assignment, it only took a bit longer than expected to get the pattern and apply it to
the code. And about 1 hour was spent working on the tests making some arrangements.
