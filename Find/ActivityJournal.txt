SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name:

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	3 00
Plan:
After look upon the activity description, which is pretty simple. All I needed to do was to use the previous class and activities as base to complete this one. Pointers are
quite similar to Arrays in terms of handling, but with its specific situations. So everything I needed to do was to thinking as Array handling but adapting to Pointers.

Complete
Actual Time	1 30
Observations:
After done 80% of the job, I realized that I was doing wrong. I was treating the Pointers as Arrays to much, so I have to figure out a way to deal with it differently. In the end, everything has worked well.
