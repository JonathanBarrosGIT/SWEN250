Ruby - Diet Manager

Name: Jonathan Correia de Barros

================================================================
Level 1 - Food DB Load - Start
Estimated Time	5:00
Plan for this level: To go through the file. Create an array of objects (Basic food and Recipe).
Try to use the principle of separation of concerns when each class would be responsible for its own manipulation.
Create the unit test files in order to assure the correct functionality of the program.


Level 1 - Food DB Load - Complete
Actual Time	12:00
Time management wasn't well enough. Most of the time was spent by learning the language.
I could learn more how to handle object in Ruby.
I thought it wouldn't be so long to finish the level 1, but it took so long once I had a lot of trouble with bugs because
of the inexperience with the language.

================================================================
Level 2 - Print & Find - Start
Estimated Time	03 00
Plan for this level: Once the class with the database was created and handled, this level would be simpler. So the plan
for this level was to create the methods within the class FoodDatabase "food_db.rb" to perform the commands. Another was to
change the menu to receive more complex commands.

Level 2  - Print & Find - Complete
Actual Time	02 00
The development of this level was very much easier and faster than the previous levels. I believe that was because of two reasons:
The assignments for this level was simplier compared to the construction of the previous one. And, the knowledge upon the language
increased a lot more compared to when I've begun coding the project.
