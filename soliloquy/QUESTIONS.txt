Suppose I wanted to change my database back end from Sqlite to a more scalable product like PostgreSQL. How would I go about that change?
=> Let's consider the change to PostgreSQL:
   First of all, you need to install the specific database. In this case, you need to install the PostgreSQL and go through the pos-installation steps.
   Then, in the file "config/database.yml" you need to change fields such as "adapter", "database", "encoding" and "username".
   Inside the Gemfile, you need to change the content of field 'gem' from 'sqlite3' to 'pg' and run the bundle command to install this gem.
   After these steps, run the command "rake db:create:all" to create the database.
   To export all information from SQLite3 to PostgreSQL, you may want to use the ruby gem called "taps", so you install the taps by the command "gem install taps".
   In order to use the taps, following is an example of how to use it:
        Terminal:
        taps
        taps server sqlite://db/development.sqlite3 username secret
        taps pull postgres://username@localhost/development http://username:secret@localhost:5000
